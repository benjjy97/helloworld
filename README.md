Did you know that davy jones once was a pirate in love with kalypso, the goddess of the ocean. She returned his love, which was her downfall. The high table of pirates wanted true reign over the sea, so with hel of davy jones, they set a trap for kalypso to ban her into a human body, away from her beloved ocean. Kalypso, betrayed by her beloved pirate, casted a curse on davy jones. He may never enter the land again, as she may never enter the sea, damned to travel the ocean for all time to harvest other souls to travel with him.
